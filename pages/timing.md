Our group at the University of Virginia (UVa) is observing and timing a set 10 pulsars using station 1 of the Long Wavelength Array. Each pulsar of interest has either not been timed before or has an extremely old timing solution published for it. 

Our group members are:

Observational data for each of these pulsars is stored on the [LWA Pulsar Archive](https://lda10g.alliance.unm.edu/PulsarArchive/).

On our website, you can also find [video recordings]( {{ site.baseurl }}/lectures ) of our sessions with information and [guided tutorials]( {{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials ) on using the LWA for pulsar observations and timing.
