Our group at the University of Virginia (UVA) is observing and timing a set 10 pulsars using station 1 of the Long Wavelength Array. Each pulsar of interest has either not been timed before or has an extremely old timing solution published for it. 

Our group members are:

**Officers**
- President: Jee-Ho Kim
- Vice President: Jason Boynewicz
- Treasurer: Louis Seyfritz
- CTO: Zach Khan

**Members**
- Coming soon to a pulsar near you!

The list of pulsars and who is observing them is below:

- J0611+30: Zach Khan
- J1929+00: Louis Seyfritz
- J2227+30: Jee-Ho Kim
- B0655+64: Jason Boynewicz


We also keep an [archived list of past group members]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/past-members/).

Observational data for each of these pulsars is stored on the [LWA Pulsar Archive](https://lda10g.alliance.unm.edu/PulsarArchive/).

On our website, you can also find [video recordings]( {{ site.baseurl }}/lectures ) of our sessions with information and [guided tutorials]( {{ site.baseurl }}/tutorials ) on using the LWA for pulsar observations and timing.
